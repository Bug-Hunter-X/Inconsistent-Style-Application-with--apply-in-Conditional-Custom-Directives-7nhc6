The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a custom directive.  Specifically, if the custom directive attempts to apply styles conditionally based on a prop or state, the `@apply` directive might not correctly interpret or apply the classes.

```javascript
<script setup>
  const showButton = ref(false);
</script>

<template>
  <button :class="{ 'bg-blue-500': showButton }">
    <div v-if="showButton" @apply='bg-blue-500 text-white'></div>
    Show Content
  </button>
</template>
```

In this example, the `@apply` directive inside the `v-if` block may not work as expected, resulting in the styles not being applied correctly when `showButton` is true.  The styles might be applied initially, or might not apply at all, depending on various factors, including the order of operations in your framework and the specific Tailwind configuration.
