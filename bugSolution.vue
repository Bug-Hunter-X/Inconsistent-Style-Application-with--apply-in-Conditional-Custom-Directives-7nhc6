The best approach is to avoid using `@apply` directly within conditional logic.  Instead, rely on Vue's class binding system which provides more predictable behavior in these situations.

```vue
<script setup>
  const showButton = ref(false);
</script>

<template>
  <button :class="{'bg-blue-500 text-white': showButton}">
    Show Content
  </button>
</template>
```

This revised code uses the `:class` binding to dynamically apply the desired classes, ensuring consistent and predictable style application based on the value of `showButton`.  This approach avoids the inconsistencies associated with using `@apply` within conditional blocks.
